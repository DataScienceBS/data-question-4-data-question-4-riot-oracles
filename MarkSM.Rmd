###The state of TN is divided in 8 core regions  
  East TN Core  
  First TN core  
  Mid Cumberland Core  
  Northwest Core  
  South Central Core  
  Southeast Core  
  Southwest/Memphis Core  
  Upper Cumberland Core    
The Mid Cumberland Core has the highest enrollment of students across all the core regions and Northwest Core has least enrollment of students.  
The Southeast Core region has the lowest graduation rate and the highest dropouts.  
On analysis we found that the percetage of economically disadvantaged is also highest in the Southeast Core. Although we found that expentidure per pupil is same for all the core regions.  
On doing research we found that if the school budget/spending is incresed so that the schools can provide the students more resources thus compensating for the lack of finnancial support from the family to provide extra resources can help the overall graduation rate and will overall improve the economics of the state overtime.
Although we found that expentidure per pupil is same for all the core regions

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```



```{r pressure, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
